# ScreenSleep
**ScreenSleep** - App that uses *proximity sensor* to turn off cellphone screen

When executing long cellphone routines - like a client app complex lengthy process, a long game action or even listening to a music player for hours - to leave the screen on, even if with its luminescence dimmed, may cause significant wear or even permanent damage to the screen.

In order to save the screen and also diminish battery energy drain during long cellphone operations, this app uses proximity sensor to turn off the display.

Activation occurs by putting anything (a small piece of paper, a fabric, etc) near the sensor.
And deactivation by putting those small items away from the sensor.

Practical and very simple.
